327,"however untrue i know this is intellectually -- for i still have family in indiana, aunts, uncles, cousins, and my grandfather lucas, who is still alive and kickin ' -- i still can not ignore this damned shade that keeps popping up over my shoulder and whisper's my worst fear: `` alone. ''"
328,"as my eyes mopped up the glamour of the greenery, i even considered changing my favourite colour."
329,my dad was a trucker for most of my life.
330,"he says, (speaking clearly for the first time) ""i apologize, sir!"
331,"i eventually got to church and while i was worshipping and singing, i must have waved my hand and the smell of tractor consumed me."
332,"a long while ago, i slept over at one of my guy friends' house."
333,every single time i close my eyes.
334,i lead a sad life.
335,red nails for my foot and pink base plus white coat on the tip!i hope the polish stay as long as possible but my nails are one kind.
336,"by the time i caught the bus, i had an ankle the size of my waist and a throbbing pain to match it."
337,"again, i nodded my head."
338,"but more, i had reached the nadir where my head knows i can do something, so thinks it doesn't need to prove it by forcing the body to achieve the task."
339,"i thought it was beautiful, but i was pretty sure it was extensions since it was extraordinarily long."
340,"my current story, where i'm being evicted in about two weeks because i no longer have the money to pay bills for the whole house."
341,"i shook my head and walked on down the street, going over it in my head the entire time."
342,tried to talk to my cousin to see whether this was really a possesion or something else.
343,"door locked, completely normal session."
344,"a pink blob thing on a corveyor belt, it was really close, and slowly went away from me ( because it was on a corveyor belt ) i heard some background noise and knew i wasnt hallucinating it, someone was walking around in the kitchen so i took the ping pong balls off my eyes to not look crazy."
345,i leaped off the gurney and landed on my feet.
346,i felt my eyes closing and had no control over them.
347,i had to wear sunglasses to keep the snow out of my eyes-fortunately the brown lenses were ok for the low light.
348,my eyes well with tears.
349,"i started to say it before he even moved his hand, but it still wasn't fast enough."
350,"i like these quiet moments, but i am not used to my head having so much quiet."
351,"he happened to be wearing two leather jackets at the time, so the machete only cut halfway through his arm right below the elbow."
352,as a parent i can tell you that trusting your parental instinct is huge..
353,"before i know it, i'm done; tears running down my face."
354,my eyelids are heavy now.
355,"many thoughts were going through my head, but i had to stop them."
356,down a hidden driveway.
357,ok this is going to get buried but this is a legit creepy story involving a jar of hearts.
358,this bird had to have a wingspan of over 20 feet.
359,he gave me my love of science and education.
360,"an hour after i got here my eyes swelled up and are so itchy, my athsma is ridiculous ( in vic i do nt even take medications!"
361,>_< </em> then of course soon followed the ritual of hopping on one foot to the bathroom to scrape off and wash my foot.
362,i banged my head on the cupboard while doing that.
363,"one flew up and landed on my knee, another kept trying to draw attention to himself by flying up just inches from my face."
364,"i reach the doorway and stretch my hands up and touch the top of the door frame and say, '' how about a cup of that great smelling coffee. ''"
365,like im laying here so freaked out cause my fostermom did nt believe me and i was bawling my eyes out.
366,"one day she came over and brought a bag of random things to ""store"" at my house."
367,i put one blanket ( folded in half because they're as thin as sheets ) around my shoulders.
368,":d as the night came, i woke up and found out that my lips are swollen!"
369,my ex is always accidentally offensive like that.
370,"i would wake up sometime later shaking, perhaps trying to rid myself of the sleep paralysis."
371,"i sat up in bed, looked around the room and saw nothing."
372,"`` i could, '' i stated simply, not bothering to put my feet down and turning away to stare at the various drawings that gerard had pinned to his bedroom wall."
373,well here you go.
374,i just do it.
375,"i looked up at him, and then quickly shifted my eyes to the side, biting my lower lip."
376,"as my friend steve called for better directions and as he was getting them, i fell again thinking i could break and quickly put my foot on the curb."
377,"it was a slow time to poop but i mean, come on."
378,then they would leave and go to their own room obviously.
379,this was about 4-5 years ago?
380,"`` i was flat on my back, the wind knocked out of me, but somehow i managed to scramble to my hands and knees."
381,i know this comment will be lost in all the others but i will contribute none the less.
382,i begged to come with him to see the house.
383,"somehow, while scrubbing the left side of my face with my left hand, my left pinkie went up my left nostril really, really fast and really, really hard, and drew blood."
384,( points to her palm for notebook and flashes ten fingers for blue's clues-which is what we do when we watch the show ) 4.
385,i went walking the other day and froze my lungs out.
386,this will probably get buried but...
387,"i fainted, and my chest was very painful."
388,"my legs felt good when i was done, and according to the hrm they burned off 960 calories in the 1hr10."
389,i thought i died.
390,i'm gonna absolutely ~~suck~~ be terrible during my first sexual experience ._.
391,i browsed my back up drive for outlook files.
392,"this plan did not work, i managed to get about 2 hours of sleep all night ( likely because of the tylenol pm i had ) because i could not get my leg into a comfortable position at any point all night."
393,"i extended my tongue, licked at the flesh, then pressed my lips closer to suck, to draw the skin and maybe a ball into my mouth."
394,"i raced across the overhead bridge, keeping my eyes peeled for a taxi, and obviously, due to the nature of cosmic fate, my bus comes exactly as i reach the bus stop."
395,the frequency never faltered.
396,my mom actually works with a lady who was on the show bridezillas.
397,my heart sank.
398,"i could hardly believe that after all this time, after so many seasons spent reaping despair, he was finally here, in my arms."
399,she picked up the phone and nobody was on the other end.
400,"sounding throughout the car was billy joel singing `` new york state of mind, '' as my eyes filled with tears."
401,`` i rolled my eyes to the heavens.
402,"i can only remember my eye getting swollen by a bug bite once before in my life, so i've really made great strides this week."
403,"they called to her to leave her vehicle slowly, without panicking, and walk towards them."
404,my ex boyfriend has been texting me every single day for a month continuously.
405,it looks like dark smelly applesauce.
406,i go in and sit down at my usual seat.
407,this story was told by my mum and step dad.
408,"my boyfriend prepared cornish game hens, lobsters, and steak for lunch every day."
409,"he had glowing eyes that were pitch black, and a face like any other human."
410,i woke up soon after with little to no memory of it.
411,"not only was i not able to move, i smacked my head against the guy sitting in front me and things just got awkward."
412,"we clue in that the surrounding forest is dry as a bone, since it hasn't rained a drop in at least two weeks."
413,so i tucked my fingers into a ball in my lobster claws and started to jog in the snow with my bike down the road.
414,so what happens is we get there.
415,so there's that...
416,i stopped rising about two feet above the bed.
417,i drive over to the party early (to help set up) and she's not there yet.
418,my dad saved my life when i was 9.
419,it's not even a conscious thing.
420,"just glad it was all sorted out now, and they took off the extra i shouldn't have paid last month off this month, that's a lot of my back."
421,' that infuriated me so much as i was frazzled out of my head so much already.
422,my ear is not as super painful today but i'm still exhausted and sick feeling.
423,"i don't mind conditioning, but with my hip?"
424,i had never had morphine before and was not bothered by the subtle burning feeling in my stomach as it entered into my system.
425,the way you're seeing it is the way it actually appeared.
426,all i can do is shake my head and laugh about this and add it to the list of `` drama i'm happy to avoid right now.
427,i hid my face in my knees not letting the intruder see my current state.
428,"i missed a lot because my tooth, which had been bugging me for a couple of days, decided to go nuts & i didn't have any pain killer with me."
429,"buried, alone, and sad."
430,"' ( today ) so the story of my grandparents ' illness continues... i'm scorching my tongue on coffee, and my head on looking at the screen."
431,but never with someone i'd almost dared to trust my heart to.
432,"it was super strong, thinking about it makes my lungs burn."
433,"i also injured my neck-it hurt so bad yesterday that it was all i could do for a few hours to sit in the recliner with a hot pad on my neck, watching friends and shoving max every time he jumped on my bruised thighs."
434,"opening my eyes late in the midnight hours, i blink my eyes."
435,"prior to, we got some humongous popsicles which turned my tongue an amazing shade of blue, and we visited the children's a&s display."
436,one day i was searching through my drawers in my room and i found a cassette tape of babar the elephant.
437,"anyway, i finished up and went back inside and decided to brush my teeth and straighten my shirttail, which had gotten twisted while sitting on the floor of the hall reading for two hours."
438,i heard footsteps going down to the basement.
439,"**elderly man**: well, there's a lot of them colored folks working there, and i just didn't feel safe leaving it with them."
440,they said they don't remember any man.
441,i could feel my heart breaking into millions of pieces.
442,"this evening's first ride adventures include: almost running over a squirrel, near personal injuries involving the seat, bugs in my mouth, eyes, and nose, and a grand performance of maneuvering my bike up my stairs, around a tight corner, and into my living room"
443,i remember swinging on the swings one day when i was in elementary school.
444,i learned so much from these classes and now my head is spinning with ideas.
445,what did i see?
446,"i saw these three lights open up in the sky, like a perfect equilateral triangle."
447,"not too scary, right?"
448,"ever the same ~ on december 16th, 2010, i fell on the ice in my drive way and broke my hip."
449,"meridian was a fashion-conscious girl, and stored all her dresses in an enormous, solid carved oak dresser, one of three in the dormitory sort of room the girls shared."
450,it always fell down.
451,i shake my head and drop it to the bed.
452,"didn't happen to me, but a friend."
453,my mind was blown.
454,"a couple of weeks later, i began to feel a knot coming up on my back by my spine, where the incision is for the catheter that was put in to the pump and then attached into my spine."
455,i still can't figure it out.
456,the light grew grater and what i saw under my eyelids caused grief.
457,"i crossed my arms, smiled, tilted my head, and said, `` i thought you were supposed to be in austria? ''"
458,"my brother snores and his snores are constant in one spot at the head of the bed, so it could not have been him."
459,he knows what's happening and passes over a gel containing more than my average monthly dosage of caffeine and i pour the entire syrupy mixture down my throat.
460,"i said the first thing that came into my head, ` ciao."
461,`` i like my toes.
462,"we went out for mexican food and margaritas; i had most of my margarita on an empty stomach, and it really went to my head."
463,i found it fascinating.
464,"that's exactly what the little voice in my head says all the time ( sometimes in english, sometimes in german )."
465,except i'm a very lazy person and i don't really like meat with lots of bones and stuff so i felt like when i tried pieces of sam's dish i was just playing with the food in my mouth.
466,"i wake from my coma, sleep crusting my eyes."
467,my friends and i were at the beach a few weeks ago.
468,i got to spend a few nights at my cousins house and it got me away from here to clear my head and just be in a different environment!
469,"not really creepy, but fairly interesting."
470,our 4th anniversary is in december.
471,"""jeff what is that?"
472,"i was in the same outfit as at the party, with the addition of a voice changing microphone under the mask and a glow stick that i stuck in there to try to illuminate my eyes a bit."
473,"in my head i just said, ""this is going to end badly."
474,i told myself i can't buy anything yet my hand just cant stop me for buying.
475,it scratched them up but hardly hurt them.
476,"fast forward to the wedding, it's small and intimate, probably less than 50 people there, and they have the reception at some hotel with a bar."
477,"to this day, the memory still brings chills."
478,we stop dead in our tracks.
479,late yesterday afternoon my shoulder began to ache.
480,"so there i was only half paying attention to the food, expecting slightly biting, slightly chewy swiss cheese and getting instead a mouthful of something warm, richly soft, and so delicious i had to stop reading and close my eyes to savor it."
481,"on top of that, i have bruising damage on my shoulders from all the carry-on hauling."
482,"`` i said, `` my lungs are black? ''"
483,""" and ""how far away is blah blah?""."
484,"i chuckled, holding my hands up, and sat down in my comfy swivel chair."
485,"we were both quiet, and i closed my eyes."
486,"i managed to throw a strike to the guy after that, but it didn't feel right, which prompted me to turn to stropes and say, my arm is dead."
487,"anyway, i got into about 2 hours of extreme defense training, i suddenly starting developing a headache right in the center of my forehead."
488,"after that, i went to throw the plastic bowls for tiramisu and my stomach acted up and i felt a little like puking."
489,"one day during practice, the question was read, ""finish, the opening line of the traditional american song which begins, 'i wish i was-'"""
490,"my heads a mixture of emotions and im full of cold yet again, cant seem to shift nothing lately."
491,"i walk right over to the tv, stand face to face with it, and begin to point at the little number areas."
492,"i went, but i was afraid to go to sleep."
493,"i kept my head clear with guaifenesin and benadryl, putting me to sleep on the first part of the trip, which was flying from columbus to baltimore to join up with the family."
494,i had something *very* similar happen to me.
495,"she threw her clothes all over the floor that's when i closed the door you should have seen the look in my eyes, woo oooo when i got the next surprise."
496,then proceeded to duck and run past him into the female restroom.
497,"as usual, i was attempting to jump off as far as i could go."
498,i was like wtf?
499,my ear had finally managed to clear on saturday and i could hear properly-hurrah!
500,"upon jumping off of the platform, there was an immediate drop for about 10 feet and then i went speeding across the wire for about the length of a football field with my hands and legs free."
501,"smooshed between him and kh, who entertained this man with a long chat, i tried hard not to be rude as i turned my face away from the reek."
502,i swear my heart halted for a split second before sprinting.
503,i think my eyes shut immediately after my head hit that pillow.
504,he came yelling and screaming in my face slipping on me.
505,my heart starts pounding just looking at it and all the thoughts of telling john to leave have wandered out of my head for the moment.
506,( my teeth were chattering so much that i had to open my mouth riding down.
507,i was also sick and running a fever.
508,that day was a lovely day for people on the internet.
509,long story short i ended up with a burst eardrum.
510,"we went to this bar and after a little while if i took a morning run i could get a small cup of orange juice, my favorite kind of juice and a small treat."
511,the nightmares and fear were new and inexplicable.
512,"i woke up at 8am, went to class in the shitty cold rain."
513,i'm suffocating on my consciousness as it slowly seeps down my throat.
514,< 3 so i can now officially say that chicago holds my heart in more ways than one.
515,so fly we did.
516,maybe it was my inability to move my legs several days after.
517,that's when tears streak down my cheeks.
518,"lisa appeared very ""distant"" to her, with a very ""dreamy"" demeanor."
519,"by the end of the class, my legs felt like jelly."
520,"clear windows to a soul too new in life, on the job, to possibly have seen more pain than watching me hold ice to my face, wiping blood off my mouth, wincing as i was inspected for injuries more severe than the bruises, the cuts, the bleeding."
521,"so i waved and walked on, and then realized several steps later that i'd been walking while he had the right of way... also, at one point a cyclist ran into my shoulder."
522,my head turned to the side and my muscles relaxed.
523,i'm nervous because nothings literally going in my head but yeaa.
524,not as bad as your story.
525,"i burn out my legs biking there at top speed, having to scale a pretty high bridge, and speed into the parking lot at around 8:58."
526,can i add a bridesmaid-zilla story?
527,"the starfish lay by my feet, its back turned to me."
528,"you know, there are not many possessions in this world that i hold more dear than the ring that my husband placed on my fingers eight years ago, this past christmas eve, and asked me to become his wife."
529,"my throat is now only a dull ache ( as one nurse said, strep throat is the throat you don't forget, boy was she right! )"
530,we intentionally had a very short ceremony planned so people could get to the reception.
531,i will probably die never knowing more of him.
532,now when i have too much to do my brain just gets distracted by all the other jobs jostling for attention.
533,my heart start to get tire because i do nt know what i am doing all these for.
534,i thought my heart was beating so fast.
535,naming a black lab leroy is not racist.
536,"he looks over and i realise how obvious i am with a huge grin on my face, looking suspicious."
537,"and i got ta tell you right here folks, that brings a tear to my eye."
538,my leg is painful...... this time i got bought a lot of new cloths... my bro also... shoe is like normal one.
539,"my eyes were closed, but i could tell he was just staring at me, figuring out what to do with me."
540,i never spent the night there..
541,"i broke trail into the snow, my low-cut sneakers not doing enough to keep snow away from my feet."
542,they dance and shiver and grin and laugh.
543,"my father, dr. sanjay"
544,"after that class, i proceeded to `` work '' ( an $ 8 an hour gig where i sit in front of computer and once in maybe 4 hours change printer paper ) where i began studying for my linguistics test to be dropped in my face at 1 pm."
545,"my eye is black, my head hurts, but i'm happy, i won."
546,"i racked my brain, constituting the list of must-haves to funny, with some romance."
547,i walked last night for about 45 minutes and i thought i was going to collapse due to my legs just not working anymore!
548,i was absolutely livid.
549,"a few days later, the rash broke out into these weird bumps that itched like crazy, and spread to my stomach."
550,"cmon, mister, he said."
551,it wasn't on my shoe anymore.
552,"i also injured my neck-it hurt so bad yesterday that it was all i could do for a few hours to sit in the recliner with a hot pad on my neck, watching friends and shoving max every time he jumped on my bruised thighs."
553,because monday night was such a wonderful time and i intend to carry it in my heart as a precious treasure.
554,then i had a reaction to a medication that almost closed my throat.
555,"i watched it fly at the apple and vanish... never to be seen again, i scoured the area (flat grass) for years afterwards."
556,so i go to the doctor and i tell him about getting the sharp pain in my back and how that hasn't gone away and how my hand is numb.
557,"determined well, i've been going to the gym a little over three weeks now, and i've lost eight pounds, and roughly twelve inches total-about three from my waist, two and a half from my hips, a half inch from each thigh, and four total from my... um... upper torso area... anyway, it feels awesome."
558,"hmmm, i guess i'm being a little difficult, because nothing in the deli catches my eye."
559,have you just tried talking to the ghost?
560,"i looked over my shoulder to find dj # 2 smiling down at me, wrapping his hands around my waist."
561,"she had a fish tank with two fish, a bottom feeder and an angel fish."
562,i balled my fist underneath the table.
563,my brain's been cooking up too many ideas that i can't even write out for future references.
564,on the way out i banged my head against the gate.
565,""" best friends ever since"
566,it was a cool day but my foot was hurting even more afterwards.
567,this was fairly recently...
568,"well, since everyone is giving their lovely stories..."
569,"one day, one went missing."
570,my eyes then drifting upwards to the cluttered mantle piece of old school photographs of my brother and i.
571,"we'll a couple months later, he died."
572,"there is a pencil in my hand, but the words are not writing."
573,"as i sat there, i started having 2nd thoughts, and voices in my head were saying, `` what's one more day of rest?"
574,"i was partly dehydrated, and partly `` festive '' and was sitting in my chair with my feet in the pool, drinking water, wanting to take a nap."
575,"by the time he reached it, it was gone."
576,would not come down.
577,"i also remember the chandelier campfires, and it was what inspired me for almost a year to tape pieces of mirror under my eyes so i could pretend i was walking on the ceilings ( though i always got a bit freaked out when i walked outside )."
578,"springislikeaperhaps, *what is this*?"
579,with a hot towel for me to put on my abdomen.
580,"the park is a small field, the only way out is at one end with a small fence with a gate, otherwise it's closed off."
581,sore my tongue pericing experince!
582,"i yell out a friendly ""to your right!"
583,and it was awful.
584,at first was okay when i let my sleeve down during duty was like so freaking warm inside my hand please.
585,my eyelids are heavy now.
586,there was a young trauma patient who had a gunshot wound to the abdomen and had gone septic.
587,"i asked ( with a pleading look in my eyes ), `` can i leave the apple store? ''"
588,she faked her own kidnapping.
589,"i can't breathe right, my head has been stuffed up for three months, i have whacked out dreams, can't sleep, i'm just... i'm... i feel like i'm breaking."
590,it doesn't budge.
591,i did most of the skills ok but when i had to remove my mask i paniced and couldnt breathe properly and the instructor had to pinch my nose to help me!
592,"so, my feet were pressed hard against the pedals which control the rudder and started losing feeling."
593,"i had a number of collisions, almost dislocated my shoulder, and am still sore from it today."
594,"i lie down on my stomach in the grass, looking over the edge of the lake."
595,"the light was pretty fucking bright, something distracted us we looked away and it was gone."
596,"now, the gray woolen hat i wear to the barn has strings that hang all the way down over my chest with tassels on the end."
597,my face turned red because i was afraid and i urinated on myself.
598,' so i held it up to my face and waved at it before swallowing it.we got home around 8:30 am.
599,"i called out, ""mum?"
600,"i place shackles around my ankles and then around my wrists, messing one up and having to redo it with a muttered curse."
601,2nd date - i get invited to her house to watch a documentary about lime disease.
602,"so yeah, creepy stuff."
603,my legs felt weak.
604,i thought it was going to be a police badge.
605,i always have thoughts zooming through my head like speeding cars running a red light.
606,my tooth was cracked.
607,"one day, we lost all contact."
608,"it stumbled upward and darted down the woods, yelping and screeching, thus climbing up another tree."
609,it was so bad that i got dizzy and my eyes kind of rolled back.
610,"and when i say online banking, it was not internet banking."
611,so there's that...
612,it was traveling up my throat from my neck and making swallowing difficult.
613,"turns out i had some sort of staph infection in my lung that i'd never had before, plus pneumonia again."
614,"few hours later, it happens again."
615,i was very scared.
616,my dad and brother were 20 feet away in the living room.
617,"even with all that, my asthma still keeps getting worse and worse."
618,"blank i had a dull throbbing pain in my arm yesterday which i took painkillers for, but ended up waking up at 4:00 am this morning with it still in pain."
619,"my heart is broke, there's nothing to steal."
620,so he knows when his equipment is faulty.
621,still hate my arm tho.
622,not normal light but a spot of light.
623,"the aisles were foggy to me, because my eyes were filled with tears that i was fighting to keep in my eyes and off my cheeks."
624,i just had my super shiok shower at my awesome home and then i use my towel to wipe my face.
625,i turned my head to oncoming headlights.
626,most meaningful and memorable:
627,"i fumble to the shower and pull out the knob, turning it toward hot.i then turn around, grab the shaver and proceed to remove the little stubble on my face that has somehow grown over the past hours.placing the shaver away, i open the shower doors and step into the... cold water!!!"
628,now my uncle and two other nurses end up tackling a patient.
629,we had hiked for about an hour through the shallow water and were looking for cool rocks and other things in the river.
630,i laughed until i cried and decided this was a friendship worth pursuing.
631,"i'm sure my face was getting a little red with frustration at this point, but i wasn't rude, i just sternly asked her to leave me alone."
632,well i have the bright idea that i need to stop being like this and i end up alone on the elevator with this girl.
633,he notes that he is disgruntled about the lack of pirate music.
634,my brain is like mush.
635,i photoshopped a crown on my head because i am very proud of myself.
636,"she looked up at me, shocked, and said, ""my dad is dead."
637,so far seems normal.
638,"the other two ran out and did their business, but not daisy, no, she had to try to yank my arm out of the socket chasing the cat."
639,just normal chatting stuff on a chat-site.
640,i rolled my eyes.

647,"i approach him start to speak... `` excuse me... what where annie's last... '', and before i could get ` working hours ' out of my mouth, a celeberty young artist of 24 stalks in, her name is silvery white."
648,"but nothing on the news, nothing in the paper, nothing on tv, no words spoken about it again ever by anyone."
649,worst day of my life to date.
650,"it worked; my feet only tingled once the entire ride, and that was after about 15 miles.2."
651,either way that mother fucker is gone.
652,( huge grin on my face now. )
653,"and this charming, gorgeous, blonde struck up a conversation with me."
654,but then i realized... it wasn't in my spine.
655,"i, assuming i knew him and just couldn't remember, waved back."
656,those memories still trigger terror sweats.
657,"i cocked my head like the rca victrola dog, and sure enough -- key in door sounds."
658,but i am at work today miserable and exhausted trying to keep my eyes focused and my head up.
659,""" as much as i urge for the answer no stranger seems to talk about it."
660,"there was nothing i could do, all things were over tears were starting to flow from my eyes."
661,"i swing and bounce while picking at my nails, another little habit of mine."
662,my heart leaped and i held out my palm.
663,"but one, one took my heart away and broke me free from my past."
664,my knees are banged to shit tho.
665,"i amazed the nurses at the hospital when the spurting fount of blood from my nose stopped immediately with my arnica.i am not a homeopath, nor do i pretend to know very much at all, really."

667,who loses a sock?
668,"it eats at me, and this is years later!"
669,i barely slept that night and didn't tell anyone about it till now.
670,my brain knows that now it is time to get girly up off the couch and into bed before she freezes to death.
671,i have to convince her to stay over with everyone else now.
672,"me nude on facebook, already two comments."
673,"one guy threatened to talk to his uncle, a judge, to see if anything could be done to incarcerate me, but i just thought that was embarrassing, especially as i've been through the police stuff and there's nothing they want to do."
674,afraid they might confirm our fears.
675,a knock on the door and my heart litarely stopped for a good three seconds.
676,the intent was clear in her eyes.
677,then i felt a breath on the back of my neck.
678,did i mention that i'm having a hard time keeping my eyes open at the point?
679,"&gt; ""why was your leg hurt?"
680,"meh, might as well get this off my chest and share it with reddit."
681,i know this comment will be lost in all the others but i will contribute none the less.
682,he wasn't suffering any longer; i believe that is where i got my strength to keep my chin high.
683,"i shook my head, put the car in gear, and had to force myself to drive away."
684,one of my friends wrecked his jeep going 80 down a dirt road.
685,"she fucking won, and wore him down."
686,"again, i sat up."
687,"when i pulled her back in, her hand went to the perfect spot on my chest."
688,i certainly didn't.
689,ha ha i have this funky taste in my mouth right now... the after taste of mouthwash.
690,"seconds later, the tears that streamed down my face were out of pure excitement."
691,by the time we left bloomingdales i could have collapsed but i genuinely think i was numb from the horrific pain in my feet.
692,this morning i woke up with a wound on my thumb.
693,"walau, i was supposed to start my gyming and exercising tmrw but i've got a bit of cough and problems with my lungs so i cant go gym tmr siaaaaaa."
694,"shitty situation, dont protect yourself with guns unless shots have already been fired."
695,"after those few seconds, i waved one hand at it in a friendly manner, it then changed light pattern and hovered away behind my house."
696,"yes after writing this morning and feeling so much better becuase i have finally somewhat working out my head, i was very happy in portland."
697,p / s: iloveyou guys from the bottom until the top of my heart.
698,to be honest its pretty easy this time.
699,we sat quietly to see if we could hear the voice again.
700,"i handed him the ipod he just moved on, i felt the blood dripping down my nose."
701,because monday night was such a wonderful time and i intend to carry it in my heart as a precious treasure.
702,later my parents called my aunt who sent it (she and her husband are very religious) and i'm sure you can figure the rest out.
703,my heart dropped and i just replied `` no. ''
704,"one particular experience i had at a place called ""hernando's bridge"", however, still scares me to this day."
705,"see, thats the thing, sean wasnt an alcoholic."

711,anyway it was weird.
712,she said she wasn't going to be at school for at least a week.
713,"we took tons of pictures hoping to find something within them and only once did we suspect a strange figure in the photo to be a ghost, however we're not so sure."
714,"2 minutes later, i hear sobbing coming from the toilet."
715,anyone who can get guitar based laughs about strap ons in a field with a fair few older people are legends in my eyes!
716,best tech support problem:
717,until then i'm just a ghost in the shadows... a very odd ghost that knows her throwaway
718,i also brought my bike to the beach and held it over my head standing in the ocean.
719,"but i wasn't ready to be that stupid yet and motivated by pride, i made one more attempt and landed on my feet."

723,i yell but i can't help but feel a sharp stave in my chest.
724,i said thank you and thought nothing of it.
725,"we get to the porch and my dog starts *growling*, like a big boy growl, like shits going down growl."
726,i was walking next to the truck on one of those raised cement curb bumpers when my ankle folded in half.
727,my last relationship ended pretty mutually...and i really tried to maintain the friendship.
728,i know it sounds silly but maybe its lonely or died horribly and is just sad.
729,"after about 5 minutes of failed attempts to get my nose to stop bleeding, i did what i could to clean up the bathroom, and i headed to the nurse's office."
730,""" and told me ""spook"" was racist."

735,as soon as i realized my lips were turning blue i sucked in a breath and started to read... hello my name is sadie.
736,i on the other hand got engaged last month after a 7 year relationship.
737,i sit there with my shotgun and wait.
738,"i stood there at the front door with the key in my hand and every time i tried to unlock it, i started shaking so much that i couldn't get the key in the lock!"
739,other objects were distorted.
740,the way he quickly suspected something wrong by just the look in my face.
741,"but then he gave me the cheek swab and i didn't think about taking it off my cheek until afterwards, so i scraped my cheek a little and held it there and moved it a couple of times."
742,it's a miracle my head didn't explode.
743,"i racked my brain, constituting the list of must-haves to funny, with some romance."
744,i pick up my head and press the cold metal to my throat.
745,prior to the opening of the hunting season in the autumn (when the whole hunting collective/club goes to hunt together) we go hunting alone.

757,"we first met hatred was in my eyes, i didn't want anything to do with you, lies."
758,"now, my ankle has been hurting for several weeks, but nothing like this."
759,"(health nut) anyways, we came downstairs to make breakfast, we popped some bread into the toaster and flipped the handle down."
760,these were easier when my family could finally touch me and hold my hand.
761,"my foot was really hurting at this point ( and still is ), presumably from the running on saturday."
762,"but i was still pepared to go to work, and i did; my condition was my own fault and i usually just grit my teeth and get on with my day."

767,"makeing a sorta clam shell, or like someone praying but sideways., around my clentched fist."
768,fishin '' i woke up in the morning my head was throbing black and blue eyed thought i'd died smashed up my tv set.
769,"i didn't leave town this weekend, knowing it was going to rain ( thus my volunteer day today w / the homeless ) whilst my shoulder is all jacked up and clicking.i think i pinched at nerve at the gym."
770,apparently my leg had fallen asleep and i didn't know it.
771,"i was sitting in the van trying to stay warm, and going over the following day's logistics in my head."
772,words that are dead lies to my heart.
773,god i cant even see straight cuz i have so many tears in my eyes.
774,"i don't feel as though i slighted the deities at the feast but i had no energy, was very depressed, and my heart wasn't in it."
775,my eyes well with tears.
776,"the odd thing is that my sister's room is heavily carpeted, and honestly it's fairly difficult to smoothly push the door open."
777,"the hand rubbing my back eased the frantic pounding in my head, making me sigh after emptying everything in that toilet, stomach convulsing from the lack of content."
778,"so i'm growing sleepy again and i rest my head on the coffee table, looking through the bars of the balcony and watching the sky turn orange and pink with the dark pine trees sticking out dark against the sky."
779,"i filled it out and tried to stay calm, but my legs were still shaking!"
780,this is where things start to get weird.
781,this is completely real.
782,theyre gonna hit me up for money.
783,"no water damage, sun damage, tears, anything."
784,has this happened to anyone else?
785,"after dousing my knee in aspercreme and a heated herbal pillow, it's stiff but doing better."
786,"still, the event was constantly played in my head."
787,"let me put it this way: i burned so much as a kid that my nose is permanently red.i look back on all of this skin damage, and wish i could go back to my old self and do some kind of scared straight intervention."
788,i changed and manage to get out of my iced over neighborhood to get there... i stand in the back putting food on trays and cursing under my breath every time i move my foot.
789,"after a month at tables and t.v. trays, i was back on the ground, eating with my legs crossed, and had no complaints about it."
790,"(but honestly, i can literally [not figuratively!"
791,wanted to quickly go home and hide my face.
792,in college we had a lot of foreign students at school.
793,"but after blinking my eyes for a few times lepas tu tampar-tampar muka sikit, memang sah la yang penghantar itu hanis zalikha."
794,and i was regret because i didn't listen to my heart.
795,"i said out loud, ""welcome"" and smiled."
796,"gots no cash, gots no jobs, no place so get off my back and outta my face! ''"
797,"my heart is clenched, a fist in its ribcage, i hold my breath, turn blue, i yield to you, my sacrifices culminate a slew, i crave you, cavegirl, when assumed assuage."
798,"i can't stand the gelatinous tomato soup bit, or the soggy noodle letters, or the taste."
799,"we end on a high note, laughing as i walked her back to her room, she thanks me for being a gentleman."
800,"i like these quiet moments, but i am not used to my head having so much quiet."
801,cant really forget the taste in my mouth!
802,"halfway through shoveling, i got '' living on a prayer '' stuck in my head."
803,"the redmond cycling club that organizes this event, had made-to-order coldcut sandwiches and -- be still my heart -- ice-cold cans of coca-cola at the final aid station."
804,"out on an unpopulated barrier island that was barely anything more than mud, sand and mosquitoes."
805,they both forgot to brick the door and he forgot his keycard.
806,... i need to get this list of shit that's happened off my chest.
807,i walked out kamiyacho station with a big question mark in my head.
808,"*creepy/unnerving* that is, and just weird."
809,my tongue had sucked it up and the hole was closed.
810,probably still awkward between them.
811,and probably murder me.
812,i nodded.i bowed my head at my seat.
813,"we just say no and leave, quite shocked at that response."
814,i was brought by to reality when noona hit my arm lightly.
815,"like valene, liesl, meihui, jason etc. ( i can't remember alot ) i really think you guys are great people and you're the bestest friends in my heart."
816,when i finally fell asleep again i had one last dream.
817,"i think i got hit in the face with at least half the shells after i fired them, but even the hot metal briefly stinging me couldn't tear the grin off my face."
818,it must be from lack of sleep last night because when i woke up there were dark circles around my eyes.
819,slowly rising to my feet i came to the conclusion that sometimes being alone meant surviving for myself.
820,"my head poked out of the grass again, catching sight of the men nearing my position, only about fifteen yards."
821,it was so weird.
822,"like seriously, alot can not understand and im slow at registering words in my brain during that time, so yeah."
823,i naively walked up and stuck my head in the driver's window hole.
824,"i had a real crappy car years ago, the sun roof would leak, the air didn't work, it would keep running after i pulled the keys out, there was a hole in the front wind shield (i would keep an umbrella shoved in there to keep stuff from flying in)."
825,this was merely seconds after the running up the stairs.
826,three of the civics move in to the right lane.
827,i looked at my wrist.
828,with my knees.
829,i will never forget that feeling.
830,"because i am breaking the pattern with someone who i care very much about, who hurt me on a very real level, and who finally opened my eyes to who i am."
831,"this 'star', starts to move across the sky."
832,"as i turned to walk out of the alley, a pair of brass knuckles crushed into the side of my face."
833,"suddenly a silver can whizzed by my head, wetting me with watered down coors."
834,i slid my hand into my pocket and took out my knife.
835,"my hands were shaking and i could feel her hatred for me, almost radiating out of my computer screen."
836,"this is my first new it cert in two years or more, and now my head is back in the game, with the letters cssss posted after my name."
837,"down, into my stomach, churning until food no longer gave me pleasure or sustenance."
838,we start riding toward the mtf and he is just getting even more ridiculous.
839,"= okay blablabla ~ and then, the dentist check up my teeth."
840,"she said she agree with me but didn't know how to leave... to that, i shrugged my shoulders, shit i know how, pack your shit and leave... i mean, you know?"
841,"this will probably get buried, but..."
842,i really hate my knee right now.
843,blood on my hands ( 2:16 ) 07.
844,"one day she came over and brought a bag of random things to ""store"" at my house."
845,he leaps straight towards my eyes faster than anything i've ever seen before and i wake up feeling closer to death than i do my skin.
846,talked with a lady online and we decided to meet.
847,"she would always scream and try to get him to swim across the river to her, but he refused."
848,"a flaming ball of fire shoots up my leg to my hip, back down and out my toes, and i involuntarily kick her!"
849,"my hands frostbitten, my ear peeling already from the cold."
850,"i stopped for water at the rest stops and got doused with a hose, which was very pleasant except my shoes got drenched so i was running with heavy sponges on my feet for the last two miles."
851,i had to get on my knees and hang over the back of the seat.
852,"i want to take a class just to take one, so my brain isn't rotting away for a semester before the fire academy."
853,i remember seeing wet cat food all over her croc shoes....only it wasn't cat food.
854,she got into a car crash and had a traumatic brain injury.
855,"^_^ i got up early today, it was too warm in my room and my ears were ringing terribly. >"
856,"when mike walked in the door, my heart skipped a beat and i had the biggest smile on my face."
857,i was scared shitless.
858,"do you have a strange sleep schedule, have any sleep disorders, or sleep on your back?"
859,"i knew we were almost there when my midwife's voice got more excited and joey leaned in real close and said into my ear, `` don't stop pushing! ''"
860,"so they decided to dabber in ""alternative"" medicine."
861,"i snapped ending the call and throwing the phone on the sofa, i sat down and throw my head into my hands a few seconds later the phone rang again `` piss off ches!! ''"
862,"after crying for the better part of the night, my eyes are puffy and sensitive."
863,"the dentist ground down my teeth so they fit together and that relieved the symptoms but, of course, my teeth were then super-sensitive."
864,"back when my son was first born, my wife and i purchased a new house and we were just moving in."
865,"the giveaway drawing was supposed to be tonight, but since this day ran through my fingers at the rate of lightning, it's being extended until tomorrow... go here to enter."
866,nothing but the dark.
867,they were dancing to bolero.
868,we looked down and watched blood streaming down from under his shorts........
869,i sell an incredible experience to my friends who are responsible enough to use it correctly.
870,"it shocked me the resistance i had to overcome to pull the sheet out, and when i got near the machine, my ears started turning up because of my earrings."
871,at this point my cousin notices that his house is decorated entirely with circus clowns.
872,we saw this flock of seagulls poking at this bag of flaming hot cheetos.
873,i was writing away.
874,"first, middle, and last."
875,i have a huge bruise on my thigh.
876,his life was hell.
877,3 ) the little old grannies that passed me up after my calves were shot.
878,and its freakin ' getting on my nerves.
879,my bedroom was next to the kitchen.
880,thy walk today with me has made my heart within me burst; as i communed with thee.
881,"on her way out of the church, she flags down the first car to pass...mine."
882,"i know lots of children have imaginary friends, but looking back on this feels very weird to me."
883,so i cried my eyes out and did the drawing.
884,the rest of the days in the week are spent just doing easy spins outside or on the trainer to flush out my legs.
885,"her: yeah, i umm ."
886,"to top it all off, my back started to sieze up, possibly due to compensation habits and stress worrying about the issue."
887,and my throat felt a little funny but i ignored it and when i woke up this morning?
888,or the darkness in my eyes.
889,a hot wind like a blast from a steam oven tossed my sweat-damp hair back from my face.
890,"when he drove through the night i would stay up with him and when it was late enough he would let me sit on his lap and let me ""drive""."
891,posted passive aggressively about me on facebook and sent me angry messages.
892,"( i was smart & bit my tongue ) oh, and great results, but i'm not going into details... ow.we spent all day together, and got pizza & a ton of beer for dinner!"
893,"so everytime someone tried to grab my hand with the camera in it, i just move it away from them lol."
894,one day i was being tailgated by some jackass in a giant pickup truck.
895,"also in the room was the father and the grandparents, all also crying uncontrollably."
896,"my heart is racing, i get dizzy, my vision gets blurry, i can't communicate my thoughts right i panic, i can't breathe properly."
897,i didn't see it move.
898,so i closed my eyes for a bit.
899,for months i stayed in the hospital bedridden.
900,when i get really cold my back gets tense and starts to ache.
901,your hacker saves your life and you become best friends.
902,and my heart bleeds.
903,"the weekend didn't live up to my storm standards, i was all prepared to watch lots of movies and spend time with the new kitty and it barely rained on and off all weekend and unfortunately i was too sick to make it to beerfest, damn tabs really upset my stomach but i was grateful for ladies night and surely think it should be mandatory every weekend."
904,we've never met.
905,"logically, i become bored."
906,the texture of the water hitting my hands and running down into the sink makes me feel happy and comforted.
907,my heart was just... beautiful.
908,murder is the better word.
909,it can repeat the same exacts movement of my hand when i drawed something or painted something that looked exactly the way i felt.
910,"next it was running from a sadistic laugh, into cornfield, i trip, fall up."
911,"anyway, a dream glitch?"
912,the next morning my right ear lobe swelled to twice its size and my ankles hurt.
913,"when i first saw tangled on thanksgiving, it ate my brain."
914,here is where things get strange...
915,"`` yes, '' bruce agreed, and i suddenly gave him a hard shove, clenching my hands into fists at my sides."
916,"in one dream, i was pulling those long, white, stringy, watery stir-fry type vegetables out of my chest."
917,i'm on the opposite end of the spectrum.
918,"i was almost last by the second corner, and i just put my head down to try and make some progress, but i couldn't do anything."
919,like really i was so omfg half the time and was cringing and my face was squashed up half the time and i squeezed the blanket so hard until my right hand became numb.
920,i will never ever forget that speed.
921,i had hardly closed my eyes when i awoke to the sound of rain banging on the roof and the sound of my alarm going off at 7:30 am.
922,"we decided to travel up a hill to explore, and as we were hanging out up on the hill it began to rain."
923,my leg was bleeding and for a while i pondered what kind of animals i was attracting with my blood scent.
924,but not even the entire content of my stomach.
925,"i had been flung on top of the bike, and the handle bar was on my stomach."
926,"there's all this stuff i got ta do, and all the while there's this constant nagging thought in the back of my head ` should i really be here?"
927,luckily fellow first grade students were awesome and they either felt sorry for me or completely forgot about it the next day.
928,"we got married in california four and a half years ago, and we're still very much in love."
929,"i managed to pull myself up, my leg was hurting, but only a little."
930,"lately i've been going through the routine and motions of living for christ and believing it in my head, but my heart checked out a little bit ago."
931,"i, being a huge stephen king fan as well, began discussing different short stories and all of his amazing work."
932,"i said in my heart, '' this too is meaningless. ''"
933,"i spent the night at the hotel, mostly hanging out in sandman & marian's room, trying to edit pics and meet about band merch while my tooth hurt cuz a filling fell out!"
934,"they find this man, still in her backseat, along with a shovel, rope and quicklime in the trunk."
935,i really wanted to add him on facebook...
936,but one criminal shoot from gun to my hand.
937,i ended up crying and pissing on myself.
938,"there were dozens of us, crying, screaming, or in shock."
939,one day i was walking out to my car and i heard something hit the ground.
940,i slowed down when i came to a fairly well known speed trap in my town.
941,my grandpa is a personal hero for me ;)
942,"long story short, during the interview i started speaking a mile a minute ( way too fast ) and sometimes i lost my train of thought ( due to the fact i was blitzed out of my skull, lol )."
943,this is creepy as hell considering people do kidnap babies.
944,"before i know it, i'm done; tears running down my face."
945,butterflies in my stomach.
946,that is all in my head i know.
947,i peer down and...nothing.
948,i went and had my neck stretched.
949,"i later figured out from the doctor that even though my arm was broken, i was impailed by something metal off the other drivers car and was told that i wasn't going to make it."
950,"an overwhelming sense of peace kept my head down, unwilling to return to the world."
951,"he said yes, i closed my eyes, and seeking from divine, i sang precisely two lines, describing, my wishes for him."
952,i felt fire in my stomach.
953,to be honest its pretty easy this time.
954,we did this like 3 times before we just decided to leave it in the closet.
955,donghae held my hand and it made me blush like hell.
956,very quiet and unobtrusive.
957,"i just had to find a corner somewhere, take a deep puff of the malboro lights i got from my interpreter, calm my nerves and try to comprehend the events around me."
958,glad your dad had more sense than that.
959,jon and i decided to see how long it took for someone to notice the ring on my finger.
960,it wasnt until 3-4 months later that i decided to spark up a conversation.
961,"finally, my hubby loaded our sleeping 2 year old into the car with me basically crawling on my hands and knees to the car."
962,im wasting my time doing nothing with my sister's e5700 hanging on my neck.
963,here is where things get strange...
964,"after a few days of just keeping at it and clenching my teeth, my blisters soon healed and bf became painless."
965,i started smoking there.
966,not to mention the fact that my back and neck kill me every day when i wake up.
967,"anyway, when i cry, i never have cry marks in my eyes sooo ~ it's like i can say i just yawned."
968,"someday, you're going to forget about psycho girl."
969,your sister is a heavy sleeper.
970,"like no-one gets it, gets me, ' cameron said quietly, sniffing and wiping her nose on her sleeve. aren't you and chase?"
971,or did your arm obey your will?
972,"suddenly i see it crouching on the floor, its bagged head hung low beneath its shoulders."
973,which means i was not picking up my feet!
974,plus ( wah wah wah ) my feet hurt.
975,awkward lunch time... sometimes i think my mouth just kinda glues shut on me.
976,"i said i didn't cry very often, but i think my eyes have been held awake for so long that tears have come and gone without me feeling or remembering them."
977,"when they ended with sweet disposition, i just couldn't believe my eyes and everything that happened at laneway."
978,it's currently snowing big flakes outside and i'm crossing my fingers and hoping for a snow day.
979,"the winner was announced & i slunk outta there briskly striding the two-point-five blocks home, inhaled vapour medication which is also miraculous, and brushed my teeth."
980,but never with someone i'd almost dared to trust my heart to.
981,"i want to take a class just to take one, so my brain isn't rotting away for a semester before the fire academy."
982,"my eye is black, my head hurts, but i'm happy, i won."
983,"i had no other option, not with the way my heart started beating erratically at the mention of his name."
984,"my mouth started buzzing, then fingers, arms and legs."
985,so i grabbed my knife out of fear and looked up but there was nothing there.
986,this was the worse night of my life.
987,there's a couple dead rats and the basement had a lot of old broken furniture.
988,it was pure terror.
989,"on her way out of the church, she flags down the first car to pass...mine."
990,my eyes were even blood shot.
991,mile 20 my feet were starting to get mad.
992,we moved to a labor and delivery room and i labored mostly on my hands and knees.
993,"i had at least a half dozen, sad songs whirling around in my head, and i'm still eager to get them lengthened and mixed."
994,"technology promised a new world, more at least than what was being offered my heart."
995,"melancholy as i laid my head onto the pillow basking in the bright green glow of the clock on my dresser, my nostrils were stung by the sharp odor of old sweat... a reminder and omen of the dream that was to follow."
996,"i called out, ""mum?"
997,the dyatlov pass incident.
998,"it is a relief to be able to write about the things that go on in my head, as well as the things that go on in my life on a daily basis."
999,"i almost got my hands on the door handle, when i realized that i had left my adderall inside the hygiene bag in the bedroom."
1000,now this is especially important.
1001,now i can't wait to get my hands on all that wall space!!!
1002,this week is the 1-year anniversary of the last time he who must not be named broke my heart.
1003,my ankle somehow blew up again ( i had a severe sprain in december as in my ankle literally did a 180 and somehow didn't break.
1004,"i have lots of acquaintances, and a few people that i hang out with on a regular basis, but i still haven't found a friend that i actually like a whole lot, because after maybe a month or four, everyone that i get semi-close to starts to get on my nerves."
1005,i guess those 3 beers i drank down at 6 went straight to my head.
1006,"my arms naturally raised outwardly, the grass could give way at any time, causing a slip on my part and tailbones bruise all too easy."
1007,"he had a good laugh, which was music to my ears."
1008,ok. about time i document this.
1009,"the tooth fairy paid for my teeth in quarters, equivalent to my age in years."
1010,well one time he actually fell asleep (foot still on gas pedal) and i was actually steering the truck for a few good miles.
1011,"yet, in the middle of math i wanted to put my head down and just fall asleep."
1012,"rather than using super-heavy db's that slow me down because my arms wear out, it was interesting to do manmakers at a lighter weight so that it was my lack of conditioning that forced me to slow down."
1013,"the insides of my eyelids flashed bright colors, all my muscles constricted, and i uncontrollably moaned his name in ecstasy."
1014,"i said the first thing that came into my head, ` ciao."
1015,*** it was 11:45 pm when my cell phone buzzed in my pocket and my eyes fluttered open.
1016,""" i broke things off."
1017,my arm feels worked out from throwing all those rocks.
1018,"left with broken shards inside my arms calmly state that nothing's wrong tell me something, where do i belong?"
1019,"i feel safe, because it feels close to my heart."
1020,"probably nobody's going to even see this, but here's mine:"
1021,"to this day, those song are ingrained in my head-the words come to me easily, and the melodies evoke images of those long summers past."
1022,"my skin was too light, and i had to have been adopted."
1023,the building recently burned down.
1024,"my freshman year, the director died of cancer."
1025,"1 time, while yelling at us, he pounded the stick on the floor and the ball came off and rolled to my feet."
1026,my back still hasn't recovered!
1027,blotted out the moon.
1028,i took a step and my foot locked underneath a tree root.
1029,"gin is escaping from my pores like an invisible gas, my head is beginning to spin, and the wind chimes are clanging outside in the night breeze."
1030,but maddy hasnt stopped.
1031,my eyes are staring up at the ceiling but i can't see much.
1032,"now the sunshine is out and bright against my right side of my face, just like it was after i had my hair done."
1033,"i asked if anyone else just saw that and right on queue my best friend says ""that hand just reach out of the entertainment center?"
1034,i'm finally going to be going back to work... haven't been able to work because of my knee.
1035,this happened in third grade and i will never ever forget it.
1036,"obviously, she's pissed."
1037,"colorado, middle of nowhere."
1038,"it's been a long time since i felt this way and i am truly ashamed of what i've become.not having a job has caused immense dissatisfaction to my life and today not having a job made me feel as vulnerable and lifeless as i did a few years ago, when i had my heart broken."
1039,"a close friend set me up on a double date with her, her boyfriend, and the boyfriend's friend on valentine's day."
1040,my arms are tired.
1041,"as i lay upon the table with my eyes closed awaiting a peaceful treatment, she began to talk... oh no!"
1042,at least i have a single room now!
1043,for some dumb reason i was running late.
1044,my fingers are crossed!
1045,i could see them all.
1046,"god did that suck, because i was pretty much biting my lip off to not cry in front of anyone."
1047,a lot of strange things happened while we lived in that house.
1048,"total: 80.5 miles ( 10,550 ' ) my legs felt great all week, which is really encouraging considering this is the first week of the taper."
1049,i guess my eyebrows were missing each other and needed to grow closer... and so they were really trying to get super close.
1050,' i shoo the leaves across my head.
1051,its very dark and foggy.
1052,my sister tells us the exact same story.
1053,she began screaming hysterically.
1054,"choir became my calling, i won awards, i put my heart and soul into it."
1055,: ( i have to kiap th guitar using my legs as i do nt wish to occupy extra seat.
1056,i was dying trying to push myself to even lift my leg off the ground.
1057,then a few days later i told her jenny wanted me to come to the basement to play with her.
1058,"i guess that, even though i have a ton of time on my hands in front of a computer, i'm just too lazy to post regularly."
1059,"thanks to some asshat losing my paperwork, i am now still in this boat, facing a warrant for my arrest even though i never did anything truly wrong."
1060,and my jaw hurts where the dentist stabbed me with novacaine.
1061,"the anger is gone, only pants - shitting fear is left."
1062,my heart jumped.
1063,it was super awkward.
1064,"but, it fits my head."
1065,"recently i've started taking the ipod with me, and there has to be something said about running, face to the wind, the ocean in sight, and the sound of bittersweet symphany by the verve thundering through my ears."
1066,it mattered not that i could no longer feel my legs below the knees as the cold january water cut off my circulation.
1067,"i had just made dinner and was sitting at the table when my heart started racing, i was thinking something was wrong with me, and my appetite disappeared."
1068,"i've spent tons of time in the desert, in the forest, camping, hiking."

1070,she was unhappily employed stripping at the time.
1071,the afterimage lit up green and orange against my eyelids.
1072,"something banged against the window (2nd floor), despite there being nothing that could have done it (the tree was too far away)."
1073,no energy and my eyes are constantly aching.
1074,"in the last three weeks, i have started looking for what's perfect about everything, instead of what's not-and perfection is showing up all over the place: on me, on people i meet, on situations... the benefit of all of those experiences showed up in my body and on my face this morning."
1075,i had just turned my back on the river to duck under some brush when i heard a slurp.
1076,i am not ok with hurting my body... my knee hurts... and when i say hurts... i mean i can barely walk.
1077,"as a person diagnosed with bipolar disorder, i was the crazy ex-girlfriend."

1080,i wanted to strip the life from my legs.
1081,same university.
1082,"this thing, this disconnected phone, fucking rang."
1083,not a problem for taking a final.
1084,"`` no need to shout my head off, dear, i can hear y-'' the dial-tone was in my ear."
1085,i had an awesome anesthesiologist who talked to me through every step and kinda eased my fears about the giant needle going into my back.
1086,(it was probably a few hundred feet away.
1087,its 11:30 pm in krakow and i can hardly open my eyes... i'm not sure i have survived the 1st day but.

1093,i pull away then go to put my hand back.
1094,"he bought the first beer, and before it was even gone i had a new full one in my hand!"
1095,sometimes i have difficulty feeling my feet-i much prefer the clouds.
1096,"i know this will get lost in the sea of comments, but here's my ""glitch""."
1097,i could not summon up the courage to get up.
1098,i burst out laughing.
1099,"seriously, sometimes my heart physically aches for what people go through here."
1100,then i started to have all these reeling thoughts in my head.
1101,i ended up crying and pissing on myself.
1102,"we spent the rest of the day riding on rollercoasters-some of which i swear, re-arranged my internal organs and left my brain temporarily in the stratosphere."
1103,"kinda freaky, but it never struck me deep."
1104,"no noise at all, no lights, it wasn't pitch black either."

1113,i still have a blank stare on my face.
1114,"the lymph node in my neck has swollen up again, which has put pressure on my eyes, making my vision horrible and painful again."

1116,my heart sped up and i liked it.
1117,silence on the phone.
1118,"in fact, i woke up with the song in my head this morning."
1119,the ones in my head... there isn't another word i know that can describe it as well as that one.
1120,"the first one was far enough ahead that it didn't startle me so much.anyway, for the gruesomely curious, here are some pics of my injuries: my elbow got the worst of it."
1121,we still talk all the time
1122,"she used sign language to ask how old lyric was and guessed that she was 2-nope, i told her-she is 3 and held up my fingers."

1125,you get the picture.
1126,i remember saying 'dad?'.
1127,"i admit that i had a little smile on my face during today's aquafit, it was a giggle i am starting to say hello and howdy do to people as pass them by in the halls."
1128,that was real fun...
1129,"thankfully, my bright blue wig stayed on straight."
1130,"of course, in the end i had a better essay to hand in ( can't remember how this impacted the grade ) but i didn't feel like the work i was turning in was mine.so when i'm editing jenn's work a shiver runs down my spine that my father is also standing above my shoulder editing my edits."
1131,had to move from where i was born/brought up just to be rid of the hassle!
1132,heart racing as well.
1133,a song started to loop inside my head.

1139,i'm not sure i really even knew what the movie was about by the time it was done because my nerves were completely shot.
1140,""" this was 2 weeks before christmas, the best business of the year."
1141,still not quite understanding what i was seeing i nervously called out my friend's name.
1142,it was so cold.
1143,"it took a while, but i got my zen thing going and tapped to a song in my head."
1144,"i would slowly drift to sleep, only to awaken at 3:02am falling from the ceiling on to my bed."
1145,"the noise repeated several times, and then ended."
1146,and then my cheeks get even redder.
1147,it scratched them up but hardly hurt them.
1148,she left in a huge hurry leaving me with the overflowing toilet after her giant dump.
1149,so basically 14-15 hours after i ate my food was still in my stomach.
1150,"this, too, scared the hell outta me."
1151,"my head was spinning as the smoke i gladly inhaled made its way to my lungs and on its way out, the rings easily dissipating into the cold air made me wonder about him for the tenth time on that night."
1152,"i've never been able to explain it properly, or provide full detail..."
1153,"there were a few storage boxes in the laundry room, including some old stuffed toys and craft supplies."

1165,i had an out of body experience that might have been a dream but it was entirely too vivid and real for me to believe that.

1167,i hide my face and become someone else for a little while.
1168,my pride hurt worse than my leg did.

1241,i had been awake.
1242,"i found refuge for my heart that was scrapped together by my second girl friend, her name was amanda."

1267,"every time it happens, the beginning of the dream is a little longer."
1268,closest analogy i could come up with.
1269,"there's not much information on it, but apparently it is somewhat historically accurate (though undoubtedly greatly exaggerated over the years."
1270,"i wandered down to the end of the block a couple times and caught bits of the band around the corner playing tom petty's, listen to her heart and the sultans of swing, the old dire straits song."
1271,"bloody scream at around 2am and again, nothing."
1272,"every single time i found a girl that i was interested in, they always ended up finding some creative way to break my heart."
1273,"by the time i caught the bus, i had an ankle the size of my waist and a throbbing pain to match it."
1274,":d as the night came, i woke up and found out that my lips are swollen!"
1275,"my vision repaired itself slowly, and the pain lessened, but the feeling that there was blood gushing out of my head didn't."
1276,she's into extreme bondage.
1277,a highly intoxicated roommate and a black girl going at it.
1278,all of a sudden we were standing on the street corner waiting for the light to change so we could cross.
1279,there was mold growing in things.
1280,"it was absolutely mobbed because of the festival and the tattoo, clambering up and down the hills near enough killed both my mum and i ( my legs still aren't talking to me ) and it pelted it down from the heavens."
1281,"sitting in a dark hallway, with flickering lights, always need to be flickering lights."
1282,"only reason i looked is because some user said ""dreads are cool""."
1283,"we paid $269 for our standby tickets, and one first-class seat was about $11,000."

1285,i start to freak.
1286,i pretty much spent my whole entire new year's crying my eyes out.
1287,so apparently they met up at the motel.
1288,but there was peace in my heart.
1289,no one is there.
1290,this man had a '60s haircut and outfit on and he was just casually staring out the window.
1291,"my back arched with every heave, and tremors ran up and down my spine.that went on for about 5 minutes."
1292,"whose is harder, doesnt matter."
1293,the job is made for me.
1294,his composure never displayed boredom.
1295,between my legs.
1296,there was no stopping the relentless torrent.
1297,"the feeling has started to come back to my eye, but i still cant raise my lip and actually inspect the damage."
1298,i woke up around 10:30 with a million thoughts rolling through my head.
1299,"if i'd have had to wait on her to drive me home, that woulda been fucking terrible."
1300,"**the breakup** -- after we graduated, she abandoned her plans to go to grad school, broke up with me and moved to the other side of the world."
1301,i've been thinking about it more and can't get my head around it.
1302,i wasn't hurt.
1303,we stare at the monitor and see him head right to the kitchen utensils section.
1304,i used this primarily to keep in touch with my siblings.
1305,i shoved him once pretty hard and put my fists up for a brawl.
1306,"as she came closer, i saw what she held and tears began misting in my eyes."
1307,3:05 pm rose lemort said... it was 18 below here this morning ( boulder ) i guess it looked pretty but i was too busy trying not to freeze my lungs to really notice!
1308,my heart sank.
1309,everyone was out in the detached garage smoking.
1310,then things get weird.
1311,"i got there way too early since i'm all new at this, didn't bring enough stuff, and had far too much time on my hands."
1312,fast forward eleven years.
1313,i know this pain.
1314,i was on my way down with 2 jars in my hands and full knowledge of the boxes upon boxes of glass jars surrounding me i am happy to report that only one jar was broken!
1315,i am stressed out.
1316,"i was able to take a bath, which felt good while i was in it and now i feel horrible again, and i brushed my teeth, and washed my hair, so give me some kudos."
1317,i haven't had a dream with them in it for years.
1318,this girl faked a miscarriage.
1319,it was late and they were asleep.
1320,he put a huge grin on my face.

1322,i saw a shadowy figure move past it.
1323,i thought my heart was beating so fast.
1324,i get the shivers to this day.
1325,nothing out of the ordinary.
1326,"the rest, i du n no, i can still feel it there, inside my head trying to bring me down again."
1327,the teacher was telling her things would get better and that the best way to escape bullies is to get awesome grades so that she would have universities begging her to attend school there.
1328,"i think i got hit in the face with at least half the shells after i fired them, but even the hot metal briefly stinging me couldn't tear the grin off my face."
1329,"amber, on the other hand, was missing a boyfriend."
1330,people curse at and even hit him.
1331,"three dimensionally i could actually make the thing i conceived of in my head, which was definitely not the case with two-d materials."
1332,"the hand returned, a welcoming gesture, an unwelcome sensation."
1333,"i was doing so well, just throwing everything as far as i could ( and i actually getting some enjoyment out of the crunching sound they made when they hit the ground ) when out of the corner of my eyes, i see my giant childhood teddy bear ( appropriately named `` mr. bear. '' )"
1334,"upon impact, i remember a crushing feeling in my chest, where i felt ( and possibly heard ) a buckle in my ribs inward to my back."
1335,- i would wake up in the middle of the night and my bedroom would be super bright.
1336,#name?
1337,"so mostly, i just kept on my feet and did a lot of walking."
1338,"thankfully, we were required to wear black pants so most was hidden."
1339,and soon well need more cabbage and potatoes.
1340,in my head the music for `` long distance clara '' from pigeon street plays as i climb up to the driver's seat.
1341,"as i put my foot on the floortiles, and started moving towards my computer, in the darkness of the room, a dark small rodent figure ran from under the computer to the other corner of the room-hiding behind some drawers.at this point everybody were awake and i had my boost of adrenaline-like the ancient cavemen heading for a hunt."
1342,"sounding throughout the car was billy joel singing `` new york state of mind, '' as my eyes filled with tears."
1343,"after we moved, they stopped immediately."
1344,"the low down >> >> all is good, found out i have sleep apnia, so i have to sleep with this god bless c.p.a.p thing that pushes air down my nose when i sleep."
1345,"he stops, scribbling down my number all quick, takes my hand-omg, it was like i stuck my hand in a socket... electric!!!"
1346,i still had the mental map of the area in my head.
1347,a lot of strange things happened while we lived in that house.
1348,hence the bat on your chest.
1349,this sucks...sorry dude.
1350,"a tear bubbled at the corner of my eye, and then slowly caressed my cheek."
1351,"after a few days of just keeping at it and clenching my teeth, my blisters soon healed and bf became painless."
1352,as i'm sitting in my car calling my mom my heart started pounding.
1353,"today, the little voice whispering inside me not to get up was the subconscious part of my brain i call amy2001, who liked to drink way too much and dance way too much and party way too much and wore really small shirts and had zero responsibilities and slept until noon on the weekends."
1354,i started down the road in the cold air and my lungs burned.
1355,"the ground is a bright greenish-tan with a slight glow that was palpable, as light is in most dreams."
1356,"while he and the others were gone, battling demona and discovering that all the humans in the city had been changed into gargoyles, i tried to wrack my brain and sort my memories out."
1357,all this hair on my head doesn't allow enough oxygen to get to my brain which makes me not think lol.
1358,i roll my ankle twice in three months?
1359,the year is 2005.
1360,"her hair was greasy, stringy, and falling out."
1361,i once woke up in the middle of the night with my eyes completely wide open after a horrible nightmare and sweating uncontrollably and shivering with fear.
1362,and that's why i never yell.
1363,"there was the shock of all my teeth on the bottom being pushed so out of whack i needed oral surgery and oh year, my jaw was broken."
1364,we're still together.
1365,i have never experienced a blacker black than the black i had inside my head for the past months.
1366,well come to know i slip on the egde of the pool i do this twisting action thing hit my hip or leg on the side of the pool and then fell in with all of my clothes on.

1372,she ended up leaving in a huff after yelling a lot.
1373,he's a reclusive shut-in.

1377,every time i listen to the feeling is a perfect medium rare stake.
1378,"i know two people, one is susan and one is suzanne, these are their real names."
1379,i politely inclined my head and said good evening.
1380,"the thrill of having this large, fat, fuzzy bee sitting calmly on my hand made me feel both honored and protective."
1381,i was able to keep my head above water but with the force of the current unable to stand.
1382,i heard a loud noise ( in the form of dr. a saying ` no ' ) and my feet skidded in panic under me; i couldn't get away fast enough.
1383,this greatly accelerated the pickles necrosing.
1384,"it was like a little ball with little black eyes, atop a long, skinny neck."
1385,"so they moved me and started running a whole bunch of lab work did a chest x-ray, a ct scan of my chest and abdominal ultrasound and an ultrasound on the baby too."
1386,and don't lie in your pics.
1387,"the lymph node in my neck has swollen up again, which has put pressure on my eyes, making my vision horrible and painful again."
1388,i'm not exactly sure what their plan is.
1389,i'm confused about it but keep pressing.
1390,"will probably get buried but, my 21st last year."
1391,with sudden resolution i took my hands from the rail.
1392,"it looked like there was a golfball on the side of my knee... a purple, blueish golfball."
1393,my roommate was asleep in his bed.
1394,"i hate the idea of not making progress, it breaks my heart to see time being wasted away, standing still-i hate the idea that i can not see the world."
1395,i wanted to get my nose pierced!
1396,it can repeat the same exacts movement of my hand when i drawed something or painted something that looked exactly the way i felt.
1397,"so i have paper towels taped to my legs and i decide that i need to get to the pharmacy i mean c'mon, i haven't been there yet today so i am overdue and i need to get some latex free gauze and tape."
1398,"for a short time, i got lost in the moment, marveling in the joy i saw in all the faces that ran past i screamed and almost jumped out of my skin."
1399,my back is jacked up again.
1400,they're all gone.
1401,"today's bus ride was the most painful one... the bus was freaking packed, there was no place for even standing... i had to stand there with my 9832048 pounds bag, my shoulder was about to break t ___ t."
1402,my great-grandad was a full blood cherokee.
1403,"hmmm, hope my finger's bone don't crack."
1404,about 6  or 7 years letter i receive this letter in the mail.

1406,slow down so i don't stub my toe when i'm running down the driveway to pick up my mail.
1407,the class is silent.
1408,my fingers and feet were the slowest at warming up again.

1410,i found out six weeks before the wedding that my dad had only six weeks to live (he had cancer for two years...a fact she was fully aware of).
1411,"of course, my ankles promptly gave way, and i floundered into his grasp."
1412,"i cleaned that up, then washed my hands real good."
1413,i turned to take a good look at the pictures and my jaw almost bounced off the kitchen floor.
1414,she started to holler.
1415,"i couldn't eat, think about food or brush my teeth without gagging / throwing up."
1416,"i am a little miffed, but one less cream soda for me wasn't a big deal."
1417,i managed to bash my nose into the straw of my drink.
1418,now i hear this terrible panicky growl and scratching at the door.
1419,"my mom eventually came to pick me up and put me in my chair, but hurt my leg in the process, and berated me the whole time for crying."
1420,#name?
1421,"obviously i am hoping that this is not a permanent state of existence so i am keeping my eyes open for job opportunities, but for now i am trying to enjoy my time at home with the little bean.one nice thing recently has been going fr walks at lunchtime on those days when d is working from home."
1422,"`` i thought that i was biting into something hard in my taco, but it was my tooth!"

1426,the clipboard shook in my hands.
1427,"poptarts, fruit, nutella, clif bar...spam?"

1429,my two friends sitting in the front seats didn't say a word though so i stayed quiet.
1430,we've been friends ever since then.
1431,not the best idea for two reasons: ( a ) i don't get paid til next month and i can't afford to replace the door and ( b ) i'm more likely to breack my foot then the door and i'm not good at hopping.
1432,"one day not only did they have one, but it was old, yellowed, an a little dusty."
1433,"he kept talking, but i couldn't hear anything but my heart exploding inside my chest, the grand finale."
1434,"1 time, while yelling at us, he pounded the stick on the floor and the ball came off and rolled to my feet."
1435,"*oh #$^%ing hell, you idiot."

1438,she wanted to fight over every single little thing.
1439,he was bleeding too.
1440,", i ended up metaphorically throwing my hands in the air in disgust and just cancelling my account altogether."
1441,we ended up keeping the old house and renting it out though.
1442,"i said `` tamang tama naa ko ' y lisa dire sa akong wrist, '' ( good coincidence, i happen to have a sprain here on my wrist ) while pointing to my wrist."
1443,"i ask her to tell me hers first, and she starts telling me how she dreamed the sears tower was falling down..."
1444,"my manager is an african american man.. who just recently got a very large black jeep with dark, tinted windows."
1445,there were many police there and interviewing the mom.
1446,a sharp stinging stripe across the backs of my legs.
1447,` lyra's coming today ' the thought jumped into my head with all the certainty of ` water is wet '.
1448,he held me tightly as my hands embraced his arms that were now wrapped around my waist.
1449,"tears fall down my cheeks, fingers tugging desperately at the arm around my middle."
1450,"my knees wobbled, i stepped back my hand reaching around in all directions for something, anything to hold onto."
1451,"the sky was only slightly disturbed, light gray, choppy clouds, but it didn't look too bad."
1452,"i spent most of the day asleep in bed, and my throat hurts so much, it nearly killed me!"
1453,i went into the closet to investigate and found nothing... /chills
1454,several races have come and gone in 2010 but my feet only aims for no less than the cebu city marathon 2011.
1455,my jaw feels really sore and the taste of blood stayed in my mouth for close to a week.
1456,that's pretty creepy.
1457,partially because my heart hurts so much to observe the animals suffering in their boredom.
1458,this little kid around 6 yrs.
1459,looking through these pics today brought and smile to my face and tears to my eyes.
1460,remember the farm-ette?
1461,i felt a timer in my head.
1462,he eyed me nervously.
1463,not a problem for taking a final.
1464,in a car crash.
1465,"also, my poly pro zipped to cover my neck, a fleece cap to double cover my ears, two pairs of gloves and socks, a thick coat, hand and foot warmers."
1466,the grip on my wrist tightened and my arm throbbed from the pressure.
1467,the breeze that occasionally crept through ajar door cooled the sweat beading on the back of my neck and brought the sounds of the waves growing larger.
1468,i closed my eyes and more tears glided down my cheeks.
1469,whats a typical possession?
1470,idk what to believe..
1471,"i got up, and made the terrifying travel to my parents bedroom."
1472,this is both really gross and creepy:
1473,the way i was positioned with the air moving made it hard to not breath through my mouth.
1474,i still have no idea what the hell that was.
1475,i'll never forget how businesslike and calm the israeli guy was.
1476,"this will probably get buried, but it's worth a shot."
1477,my head was splitting.
1478,"i cried, every time."
1479,i smiled and cocked the sword up on my shoulder.
1480,key then hit me on the side of my head.
1481,we hear a man grunt and the screams stop rather abruptly.
1482,"when my stomach began to complain about the lack of room for more, i decided the rest of me hadn't had enough just yet."
1483,"broke his leg, mom hospitalized, failing exams."
1484,it's difficult to make real friends.
1485,no time to explain and no one understood it was a misunderstanding.
1486,"then i did something that made me feel sad slammed my shoulder into the door frame, and i'm feeling bad i got the boo boo blues from my shoulder to my toes got the boo boo blues even got a runny nose."
1487,"i'm frozen for a few moments, tears welling to my eyes as i try to squash the emotions."
1488,"i was happy again, and my wrist healed up."
1489,"and bond we did, right then and there, me partially asleep on son's twin bed and son running cars and trains over the length of my head and body, squealing in delight."
1490,"long story short, my ex's friends end up running down the highway, with my ex in pursuit."
1491,when i opened my eyes it was dark and i could hear my sister and her son preparing supper in the kitchen.
1492,my heart melted and the tears started to well up in my eyes straight away.
1493,""" i'm terrified that they're going to kill her, beat her, rape her, all of the above."
1494,"i can't sing it in my head because i don't know the japanese lyrics well enough, so it's a little frustrating."
1495,i cried so my eyes must be puffy and red.
1496,"i know i can make it, i know i can make it."
1497,"after i rationalized a bit, i calmed down."
1498,( very rare ) it was so cold that i can't even place my feet on the floor... weather in the morning when it was raining... the sky was so dark... this photo was exclusively taken by my new w910i which is 2days old.
1499,i then see it.
1500,"i kept my eyes down, my tail flicking nervously."
1501,"i've had other falling/flying dreams, and the sensation was completely different and immensely stronger."
1502,my heart and my mind are in constant conflict and it's driving me crazy.
1503,plus ( wah wah wah ) my feet hurt.
1504,"i started getting knots in my stomach because i was extremely excited, yet completely terrified, because i can hardly function like a normal person in front of tom."
1505,"after a bus ride, i found myself in a small town with my thumb out, next to walmart."
1506,"it was pretty scary; i had to breathe into a funny-looking thing and the worst part was that i had to have not one, but two shots in my legs!"
1507,i used to be best friends with this guy.
1508,"he said he was just traveling to experience life, man."
1509,"i am now living alone, thank god."
1510,"it didn't freak me out so much as blow my mind, the odds must have been astronomical."
1511,my head is killing me.
1512,my parents took me up there for my 16th birthday.
1513,"i slammed my fist against the door and yelled, open up!"
1514,she got into a car crash and had a traumatic brain injury.
1515,"quite full in my heart actually, for affirming this man, so lovingly, and fearlessly."
1516,i get there and i burst into tears.
1517,wash my face like 2 times a day with benzoyl peroxide.
1518,and my feet hurt.
1519,"after 3 or 4 more times, he finally gave up and left."
1520,my stomach must be returning to normal size after months of unnecessary stretching.
1521,"i once went down on him to discover, to my great dismay, a rather sizeable piece of tp stuck in his butt hairs"
1522,my leg so tired 4.
1523,scared me shitless each time it happened.
1524,poor little guy was completely *covered* in fleas.
1525,there were lots of english songs so i eventually got into it even though my ear was not happy.
1526,"unfortunately, this night happened to be very cloudy."
1527,i still have the card and the bank cannot explain it.
1528,i met a girl online and we decided to meet up for drinks at a bar.
1529,sage grabbed my toothbrush this morning and showed me how to brush my teeth.
1530,"my toes curled, this time in frustration, and my eyes narrowed as i stubbornly continued to look."
1531,"terrible, terrible deja vu."
1532,"it was a perfectly clear night, and i mean like we could see the milky way."
1533,she refused to go to the doctor.
1534,i have a friend whose husband died last year.
1535,"because this is a karma thread, you know how this ends."
1536,"oh, my head is heavy-therefore i look so straight ahead, as i sway about."
1537,"but occasionally, my nerves still do get the best of me, and i start to flop around in the breathless panic of a fish pulled out of water and tossed onto the floor to die helplessly."
1538,she is extremely smart but shy so she made a great target for all the other students.
1539,"pops been moved out of icu now and he's going well, but now i've sprained my wrist... stupid hockey!"
1540,& # x 26; nbsp; i gave them a quick glance and nodded my head and for the first time i felt like i had some sort of common bond with someone in this town.
1541,he was an alcoholic.
1542,"i got there way too early since i'm all new at this, didn't bring enough stuff, and had far too much time on my hands."
1543,it seemed so arbitrary.
1544,my boyfriend was at university training to be a primary school teacher.
1545,it was the building the man was walking to.
1546,"at that point i started having a weird feeling... there were all sorts of warning bells going off in my head, i was sick and i was dizzy."
1547,"i started to say it before he even moved his hand, but it still wasn't fast enough."
1548,and the turbulence and near-death experiences.i hurt my neck again too.
1549,"i noticed a bit of an orange in the sky, but i just thought it was street lights or an odd reflection from the moon or something."
1550,i'm lost in my own little world.
1551,no one else in the class did.
1552,i fall to my knees in fear for this dark figure is now staring at me.
1553,"good runs mixed with bad, and admist many break downs and break throughs i finally got my head on straight and ran the 16 miles."
1554,you will want to as well.
1555,the measly firing ensued.
1556,but then it got so hot i opened it and welcomed the cold spray on my face.
1557,its very dark and foggy.
1558,""" and she was right."
1559,not a thing missing.
1560,my face lurched off of the desk and i banged my head on the top piece and flew back in to my seat with such force that i knocked a letter opener off of the top and it fell.
1561,"for me, it's more like my head is full of butterflies."
1562,"so i walk up to the doctor, shake his hand, then inject him with the killing sauce he just gave to me from my freshly filled needle."
1563,i'll explain myself...
1564,i did settle down and dry my eyes on my sleeve.
1565,i love telling this story.
1566,"has oil of cloves in it, so my mouth has a continuous, though faint, taste of cloves -- it reminds me of spice drops ( apparently, there's a clove-flavored spice drop )."
1567,"i was trying to concentrate on not falling, but i totally slipped and almost fell on my face."
1568,there was no feeling to compare.
1569,"i once went down on him to discover, to my great dismay, a rather sizeable piece of tp stuck in his butt hairs"
1570,"however, it was high enough that the direction we were going, adjacent to it, gave me enough of a look to know it wasn't some kinda projection, it seemed solid."
1571,i stopped rising about two feet above the bed.
1572,i think my calf super muscular le.
1573,"i peeled my eyes away from the gory mess in front of me, and tired to make an assessment of the rest of my surroundings."
1574,"we took tons of pictures hoping to find something within them and only once did we suspect a strange figure in the photo to be a ghost, however we're not so sure."
1575,we were powerless against what happened that night.
1576,the same thing happened again so my arm was sore.
1577,and feel free to talk behind my back in front of me.
